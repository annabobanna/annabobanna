# About Me


**annabobanna/annabobanna** is âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ 



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate course
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to transition from web design to cybersecurity
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, but I'm open to collab invites

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: you can message me here for now
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: When I turned 18 (some moons ago) I had my name legally changed to "Anna" from "Ana" because it bothered me so much that people kept spelling it with double N. And now, everyone spells it with one N. Go figure.
